I want to create a LRU cache to store values. Every time when I add a new value to the cache, it will become the head. Every time when I check an existing value, it will move to the head as the most recently used value and the tail is the least recently used value. If the cache is full, I will delete the tail and then add the new value. Considered the time complexity of O(1), an appropriate data structure should be doubly linked list. I use map and doubly linked list to maintain the structure of LRU cache: the head stores the node with the most recently used key and the tail stores the node with the least recently used key.
